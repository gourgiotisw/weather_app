Additional Notes
Favorites File: The favorites.txt file is created in the project root when you save your first favorite city. It is ignored by Git via .gitignore.
Error Handling: The application includes enhanced error handling for network issues and invalid API responses.
Python Version: Ensure you're using Python 3.6 or higher for compatibility.
Common Issues and Solutions
Invalid API Key Error
Problem: Receiving an error message about an invalid API key.

Solution:

Verify that your API key is correctly entered in the config.ini file.
Ensure that your OpenWeatherMap account is active and the API key is valid.
Wait up to 2 hours after generating a new API key for it to become active.
Module Not Found Errors
Problem: Import errors such as ModuleNotFoundError or ImportError.

Solution:

Ensure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt.
Activate your virtual environment if you're using one.
Check that you're running main.py from the project's root directory.
Virtual Environment Issues
Problem: Problems activating or using the virtual environment.

Solution:

Recreate the virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment before installing dependencies and running the application.
